<h1>Apple Inc.</h1>

<p>Apple Inc. is an American multinational technology company headquartered in Cupertino, California, that designs,
	develops, and sells consumer electronics, computer software, and online services. It is considered one of the Big
	Five companies in the U.S. information technology industry, along with Amazon, Google, Microsoft, and
	Facebook. Its hardware products include the iPhone smartphone, the iPad tablet computer, the Mac personal
	computer, the iPod portable media player, the Apple Watch smartwatch, the Apple TV digital media player, the AirPods
	wireless earbuds, the AirPods Max headphones, and the HomePod smart speaker line.</p>

<p>Jobs and Wozniak hired a staff of computer designers and had a production line starting in Jobs' garage. Apple went
	public in 1980 to instant financial success. Over the next few years, Apple shipped new computers featuring
	innovative graphical user interfaces, such as the original Macintosh in 1984, and Apple's marketing advertisements
	for its products received widespread critical acclaim. However, the high price of its products and limited
	application library caused problems, as did power struggles between executives. In 1985, Wozniak departed Apple
	amicably and remained an honorary employee, while Jobs resigned to found NeXT, taking some Apple co-workers with
	him.</p>
