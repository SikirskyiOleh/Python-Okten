		§ History</a></i></p>

	<p>HP Inc. was formerly known as Hewlett-Packard. Hewlett-Packard was founded in 1939 by Bill Hewlett and David
		Packard, who both graduated with degrees in electrical engineering from Stanford University in 1935. The company
		started off in the HP Garage in Palo Alto, California. On November 1, 2015, Hewlett-Packard was renamed to HP
		Inc. and the company enterprise business were spun off and renamed to Hewlett Packard Enterprise</p>

	<h3 id="link2">As HP Inc.</h3>

	<p>In May 2016, HP introduced a new PC gaming sub-brand known as Omen (reusing trademarks associated with VoodooPC),
		including gaming laptops and desktops (with the latter offering options such as water cooling and Nvidia GTX
		1080 graphics, and promoted as VR-ready), and other accessories (such as monitors) designed to cater to the
		market.</p>

	<p>In November 2017, HP acquired Samsung Electronics' printer division for $1.05 billion.</p>

	<h3 id="link3">Hostile takeover bid by Xerox</h3>

	<p>On November 5, 2019, The Wall Street Journal reported that print and digital document company Xerox was
		contemplating acquiring HP.[9] The company unanimously rejected two unsolicited offers, including a
		cash-and-stock offer at $22 per-share.[10][11] HP stated that there was "uncertainty regarding Xerox’s ability
		to raise the cash portion of the proposed consideration" (especially given that Xerox is a smaller company in
		terms of market cap than HP), and noted the company's aggressiveness.[11] On November 26, 2019, Xerox issued a
		public letter defending allegations by HP that its offer was "uncertain" and "highly conditional", and declared
		its intent to "engage directly with HP shareholders to solicit their support in urging the HP Board to do the
		right thing and pursue this compelling opportunity."</p>
